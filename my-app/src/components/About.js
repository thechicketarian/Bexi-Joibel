        <p>  <h1> About Me </h1> Buenas, my name is Bexi Joibel aka <b> <i> The Chicketarian! </i></b> I am a Web Designer originally from Panama currently living in Austin, Texas. I love to work in all aspects of design but ultimately obsess over front-end, web design, UI/UX, and book design.
<br></br> <br></br>
As a designer, I love to learn and evolve as I adapt my knowledge to ever evolving industry, whilst establishing my own style. As a junior developer, I'm looking forward to joining a team with great opportunities to help enhance my skills, develop my potential, and meet higher expectations. When I am not designing, I love to play sports (Glory glory Man Uniteddddd!), draw, travel, and get lost in the world of YouTube!   </p>
